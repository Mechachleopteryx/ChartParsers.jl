[![Build Status](https://github.com/rdeits/CrypticCrosswords.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rdeits/CrypticCrosswords.jl/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/rdeits/ChartParsers.jl/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/rdeits/ChartParsers.jl?branch=master)

This package contains a simple implementation of a chart parser for context-free grammars, with both bottom-up and top-down prediction rules available.

The algorithms implemented here are based on the excellent descriptions by Blackburn and Striegnitz, available online at <http://cs.union.edu/~striegnk/courses/nlp-with-prolog/html/index.html>

This package was developed to support [CrypticCrosswords.jl](https://github.com/rdeits/CrypticCrosswords.jl).
